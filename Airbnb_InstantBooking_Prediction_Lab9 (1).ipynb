Specifically, the price column had many listings far above the upper quartile, indicating extremely high prices that could skew the model.

The availability_365 plot was more balanced but still showed a wide range in availability.\n",

This helped eliminate extreme values that could negatively influence the model’s performance. I removed 1,903 outliers from price, 3,121 from number_of_reviews, and 8 from maximum_nights. After cleaning, I checked the skewness of price and found it to be 0.93, which is mild and doesn't require log transformation.

    "2. Model Selection and Additional Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "As my task is to predict whether an Airbnb listing is instantly bookable (a binary classification problem), I will begin with a Logistic Regression model as a baseline because it’s simple, interpretable, and works well when features are numeric and clean  which I ensured during data preparation using one-hot encoding and outlier removal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results, I may later explore more advanced models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost), which can capture complex interactions between features without needing scaling. However, because Logistic Regression (and other models like SVM or KNN) are sensitive to the scale of data, I plan to apply feature scaling using StandardScaler before training. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will also need to address the class imbalance in the target variable (instant_bookable is about 73% \"no\", 27% \"yes\") by using stratified sampling during the train-test split and possibly applying class weights to ensure the model doesn’t ignore the minority class. These steps will help build a fair and balanced model that reflects the real-world distribution of listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Evaluation and Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate how well my model performs, I will use multiple metrics instead of just accuracy, since the target variable is moderately imbalanced. Metrics like precision, recall, and the F1-score will help me understand how well the model identifies both bookable and non-bookable listings without favoring the dominant class. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will also use the ROC AUC score to get a sense of how well the model separates the two classes overall. Initially, I’ll apply a train-test split with stratification to preserve class balance, and later I might incorporate cross-validation for more reliable performance estimates. If the initial model underperforms on the minority class, I’ll try strategies like tuning hyperparameters (e.g., with GridSearchCV), and adjusting class weights. My goal is to ensure the model is not only accurate overall but also performs well across both classes to support fair predictions.\n"

I also removed free-text fields like `description`, `name`, and `host_location`, which would require complex NLP techniques and are not critical for this classification task. I retained numerical features such as `price`, `accommodates`, `bathrooms`, and `number_of_reviews`, as well as categorical features like `room_type`, `host_is_superhost`, and `neighbourhood_group_cleansed`, which were transformed into numeric format using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data for modeling, I applied the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Missing value imputation**: Filled missing values in `bedrooms` and `beds` with the median.\n",
    "* **One-hot encoding**: Used `pd.get_dummies()` on categorical features with `drop_first=True` to avoid multicollinearity.\n",
    "* **Outlier removal**: Applied IQR-based filtering to remove extreme values in `price`, `maximum_nights`, and `number_of_reviews`.\n",
    "* **Class imbalance check**: Identified moderate class imbalance (73% not bookable vs. 27% bookable); will address using stratified sampling and class weights.\n",
    "* **Target variable conversion**: Converted `instant_bookable` from boolean to integers (`True` → 1, `False` → 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to use the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression**: As a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability.\n",
    "* **Random Forest**: To capture nonlinear patterns and interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training, Validation, and Selection Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split the data** using stratified train-test split to preserve the class distribution.\n",
    "2. **Scale numerical features** using `StandardScaler` where appropriate (e.g., for Logistic Regression).\n",
    "3. **Train multiple models**, starting with Logistic Regression, then tree-based models.\n",
    "4. **Evaluate model performance** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Accuracy\n",
    "   * Precision, Recall, F1-Score\n",
    "   * ROC AUC (important for evaluating minority class performance)\n",
    "5. **Tune hyperparameters** using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV with cross-validation.\n",
    "6. **Select the best-performing model** based on validation metrics and how well it generalizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan ensures that the model is trained on clean, balanced data, is interpretable, and generalizes well to unseen Airbnb listings."

    "To further improve the model’s ability to identify instantly bookable listings, I trained a Random Forest classifier using class weighting to address the class imbalance. Unlike logistic regression, Random Forest is capable of modeling complex, nonlinear patterns and does not require feature scaling. After fitting the model, the evaluation results showed substantial improvement. The accuracy increased to approximately 79%, and the ROC AUC score rose to 0.81, indicating strong class separation. Most importantly, the model’s recall for the minority class (instantly bookable = 1) improved from 0.11 in the baseline logistic regression to 0.35, and the F1-score increased from 0.19 to 0.47. Precision for class 1 also reached 0.72, reflecting a better balance between correctly identified bookings and false positives. These improvements suggest that Random Forest is better suited for this classification task, particularly when the goal is to improve performance on the minority class. Overall, the Random Forest model provides a more balanced and reliable prediction, making it a strong candidate for the final model."

This is a valuable prediction because instant booking improves the user experience by making it faster and easier for guests to secure a place to stay. If Airbnb can identify what factors make a listing instantly bookable, the platform can help hosts adjust their listings to attract more bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges in the dataset was class imbalance. Only about 27 percent of listings were actually instantly bookable. This means that most models would naturally favor the majority class and ignore the minority. If left unaddressed, this would result in a model that appears accurate overall but completely fails to predict the listings we care most about.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data for modeling, I first removed features that were mostly empty or too complex for the current project scope. For example, I dropped free-text columns like \"description\" and \"name\" because they would require natural language processing. I also dropped \"amenities\" because it was stored as a string and not usable in its current format. Features with too many missing values or unclear meaning, like \"host_about\" and \"host_acceptance_rate,\" were also excluded to reduce noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the features I kept, I filled in missing values using median imputation and removed outliers using interquartile range filtering. I applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables like \"room_type\" and \"neighbourhood_group_cleansed\" into numerical form. Finally, I scaled the data using standardization to prepare it for models that are sensitive to feature size.\n",

    "The best results came from a Random Forest classifier. This model naturally handles complex patterns in the data and works well with imbalanced classes. I used GridSearchCV to test different combinations of model settings. The best model used 200 decision trees, no max depth, and class weighting. It achieved a strong ROC AUC score of about 0.815.\n",

    "This score is important because it tells us how well the model separates the two classes, even if one class is much smaller. A higher score means the model can make more confident predictions. It also confirms that the model is not just memorizing the training data but learning meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the Random Forest model is the most reliable option. It was trained on clean and balanced data, carefully tuned, and evaluated using the right metrics. This model can be trusted to guide decisions about how to make listings more attractive and increase the chance of instant booking."
